# System-Design-01

Here's a comprehensive question I would ask to assess an engineer's understanding of system design in the context of a notification system:

**Design a Notification System for a Large-Scale Social Media Platform**

Imagine you are tasked with designing a notification system for a social media platform with millions of users. This platform supports various types of notifications, including:

* **Direct Messages:**  Real-time alerts when a user receives a new message.
* **Social Interactions:**  Likes, comments, shares on posts and other content.
* **Friend Requests:**  Notifications when someone sends a friend request.
* **Promotional Notifications:**  Information about new features, events, or offers.

Users should have control over:

* **Notification Preferences:**  Which types of notifications they want to receive and through which channels (e.g., push, email, in-app).
* **Frequency:**  How often they receive notifications (e.g., immediately, daily digest).
